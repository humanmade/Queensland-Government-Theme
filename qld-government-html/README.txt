** Background, premise and Copyright

CUE template version 3.2. Use this file to assist in meeting version 3.2 of the CUE template conformance requirements.
The files contained in the zip file include the (X)HTML source files, various page models, Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files, JavaScript files and images for use in implementing the CUE template. The Consistent User Experience template, derived from the Consistent User Experience Standard and principles of Information Standard 26 was developed collaborative by staff from across many Queensland Government agencies to reduce duplication of effort and redundant resourcing. The template has been thoroughly tested and is continually evolving.

The template uses CSS for presentation and layout and to facilitate adoption of the template, the code has been presented succinctly. The template represents an example in line with current and emerging best practices in web development.

*** Web design
The implementation of the CUE standard is not an attempt to bring web design to the lowest common denominator or return to text only web sites. Rather it challenges web developers and content providers to consider both information and information design within the context of universal and consistent accessibility. CUE is a model of how the Queensland Government will provide electronic information to the public and to its employees today and in the future.

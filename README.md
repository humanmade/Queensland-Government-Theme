## Creating Issues

After working on Dilei we've decided to move away from creating an issue then turning it into a Pull Request using Hub.
The new process is as follows:
* Create an issue
* Assign the issue to a developer
* The developer will create a new branch [issue number]-[issue-name]
* The developer will push this branch early and often.
* When the developer is ready for code review a pull request will be created and the description will reference the issue that it fixes.
* The developer will add the label 'Review Merge' and assign the pull request to another developer or ask for someone to code review it in Slack
